WindowsApps folder full access

I want to rename a file in UWP application filder under %PF%\WindowsApps.

I made the current user the owner of the WindowsApps directory. I removed attribute inheritance for this directory. I gave full access to the directory and its subdirectories to both the current user and for everyone. I checked effective access rights - everything is allowed for the file that I want to rename. But when I try to rename it, the system first asks for an access rights elevation, after that it says that there are not enough rights to rename file

I can't understand what else is needed to rename file.
